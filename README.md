BookMyStay Hotel Booking App
A modular, console-based Java application that simulates hotel booking operations.
The app evolves through sequential use cases (UC1–UC6), each extending functionality while preserving prior features.

UC1: Room Inventory Setup
Goal: Allow Admin to define room types, counts, and prices.
Description: Admin can add new room categories (Single, Double, Suite), set availability, and assign base prices.
This establishes the foundation for all booking operations.

UC2: Guest Search & Availability
Goal: Enable Guests to view and check room availability.
Description: Guests can browse the current inventory, check specific room types, and see pricing.
This provides transparency before booking requests.

UC3: Booking Request Queue
Goal: Allow Guests to place booking requests.
Description: Guests submit booking requests that are stored in a queue.
Requests remain pending until processed by Admin, ensuring fairness and order.

UC4: Reservation Confirmation & Room Allocation
Goal: Admin confirms bookings and allocates unique room IDs.
Description: Admin processes requests from the queue, assigns room IDs, and updates inventory atomically.
This prevents double-booking and ensures reliable allocation.

UC5: Add-On Service Selection
Goal: Guests can enrich bookings with optional services.
Description: During booking requests, Guests select add-ons like Breakfast, Spa, or Airport Pickup.
These services are attached to reservations and displayed upon confirmation.

UC6: Booking History & Reporting
Goal: Maintain a complete audit trail of confirmed reservations.
Description: Confirmed bookings are stored in a history list.
Admin can review past reservations, cancel bookings, and generate reports (total bookings, breakdown by room type).
This supports customer service and reporting needs.
